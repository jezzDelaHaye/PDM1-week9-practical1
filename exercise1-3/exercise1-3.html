    <h1>Exercise 1.3</h1>

            <p><strong>This is a challenging exercise.</strong> You can decide whether or not you are ready!</p>
            <p>Remember the level generator from last practical (W8P2 &gt; exercise1-4)? If not, here is an image of it to jog your memory:</p>
            <img src="./assets/level-generator.png" width="350px" height="300px" alt="The level generator from last practical">
            <p>A common reason for refactoring code is to modify existing features or add new features. In lecture, I showed you some (mock) user 
                feedback for the level generator:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The tiles are too small on larger screens.</li>
                <li>Users want to be able to use their own sprites.</li>
                <li>Users want more sprite choices (&gt; 5).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your task is to refactor the level generator code to address that feedback (assuming that users are willing to edit 
                the values of a few constants). sketch.js contains the sample solution for the level generator code. Feel free to 
                replace it with your own code. In the requirements below, assume that the user will run the code on their own computer 
                and will make a few modifications to get it to work for their project.
            </p>
            <p>Here are the requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To adapt the code for their situation, the user should only need to make small edits to the values of global constants or one or two lines of code in the <code>preload()</code> function.</li>
                <li>In place of the hardcoded images (e.g. grass, rock, sand), users should be able to make a few small modifications to the code to load in any images from the assets 
                    folder as long as they are all the same size, square, and follow a clear naming convention (see the "PathAndObjects_X.png" images in the 
                    assets folder for this exercise for examples). They should not need to hardcode the file location of each image.
                </li>
                <li>There must be a global constant called <code>GRID_SIZE</code> that stores the size of each image in pixels. Users will be able to modify the value of this constant 
                to work for their images. For example, the "PathAndObjects_X" images are 32px by 32px so, to load in these images, the GRID_SIZE value can be set to 32.</li>
                <li>The code should work for differing numbers of tile images. For example, there are 256 "PathAndObjects_X" images in the assets folder, but the user should be able 
                    to use fewer or more images with minimal need for modification in the code.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example output (the user has modified the code to create a level generator using the images in the assets folder):</p>

                    <p>The key to this task is making good use of global constants and arrays throughout the code. Avoid hardcoding anything other 
                        than constant values.
                    </p>
                    <p>You will need to write code to calculate the size of the canvas (split into a drawing area and a button panel) based on the size and number 
                        of tile images the user wants to use.
                    </p>
                    <p>You will need to make modifications throughout the code to make it as flexible as possible.</p>
